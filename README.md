# to-do-list
A to-do-list created from front-end website development: https://cyk19.github.io/to-do-list/

I designed this website with the source code reference from [w3schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_todolist.asp)

Designing this website, I have learned: 
1. Syntax of Javascript
2. How HTML DOM elements react to JavaScript functions
